This is the library introduced in [Garfield: System Support for Byzantine Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9505133), co-authored by Rachid Guerraoui, who supervised the project.

Garfield is implemented in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, which can be found in their respective directories.

In each of these directories, you can find complete information on the requirements of the software, how to install 
it and use it.
